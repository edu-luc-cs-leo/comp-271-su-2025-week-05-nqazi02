# Week 04 Reflection

Comparing my DoubleLinkedList implementation with the posted solutions revealed several insights:

### What I Did Well:
1. **Tail Optimization**: Correctly implemented the tail reference in `add(Node node)`
2. **Wrapper Method**: Properly created the `add(String)` wrapper method
3. **Size Reporting**: Correctly returned `this.size` for node count

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Code Factoring**: My initial `add(Node node)` had duplicate tail assignment that could be optimized
2. **CompareTo**: Used a complex string comparison instead of the simpler size comparison
3. **IndexOf**: Had an off-by-one error in my initial implementation

### Key Learnings:
1. **Wrapper Methods**: Learned how they can simplify code and reduce duplication
2. **DRY Principle**: Saw how factoring out common operations improves maintainability
3. **Edge Cases**: Better understand how to handle boundary conditions in linked lists

### Improvement Plan:
1. **Pre-Implementation Review**: Will write pseudocode before coding to catch logic errors earlier
2. **Peer Review**: Partner with classmates to cross-validate solutions
3. **Test Cases**: Create more comprehensive test cases before implementation

This comparison showed me how elegant solutions often emerge from multiple iterations - something I'll emulate in future work.
