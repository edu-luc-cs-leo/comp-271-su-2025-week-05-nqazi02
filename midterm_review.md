# Midterm Review Reflection

### Learning from Mistakes
During the first five assignments, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow as a programmer. My most common mistakes included:

1. **Compilation Errors**: In Week 2, I initially struggled with method implementations that wouldn't compile due to incorrect return types. Through careful debugging and reviewing compiler messages, I learned to methodically check method signatures before implementation.

2. **Documentation**: Early submissions lacked sufficient Javadoc comments and inline explanations. After feedback, I developed a habit of writing documentation before implementing methods, which actually improved my coding efficiency.

3. **Programmer Pact Violations**: I once used an `import` statement unnecessarily before realizing simple array operations could be done natively. This taught me to carefully review requirements.

The pattern I noticed was rushing through assignments without proper planning. To improve in the second half, I'll:
- Start assignments immediately after they're posted
- Create implementation outlines before coding
- Review the Programmer's Pact before each submission

### Course Engagement
My engagement has been:
- **Timeliness**: Attended all classes on time
- **Consistency**: No absences
- **Participation**: Asked questions during labs but could contribute more in lectures
- **Proactiveness**: Reached out twice via email with questions
- **Initiative**: Experimented with MarkDown for reflections
- **Commitment**: Averaging ~6 hours/week outside class (below the 9-hour target)

For the second half, I'll:
- Increase study time by scheduling fixed blocks
- Prepare questions before each class
- Attempt additional practice problems weekly
